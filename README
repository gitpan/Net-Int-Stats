==========================

NAME
    Net::Int::Stats - Reports specific ifconfig values for a network interface

SYNOPSIS
    use Net::Int::Stats;

    # get value for specific interface
    my $int     = 'eth0';
    my $stat	= 'rx_packets';
    my $packets = $get->value($int, $stat);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides various statistics generated from the ifconfig command for specific interfaces. 
    RX values consist of packets, errors, dropped, overruns, and frame. TX values consist of packets, 
    errors, dropped, overruns, and carrier. In addition, collisions and txqueuelen are reported. Values 
    are in the format of type:n - ex 'packets:123456'.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module is platform dependent. It uses the linux version
of /sbin/ifconfig. Other platforms such as the windows equivalent
of ipconfig, mac osx, and other versions of unix are not supported. 
This is due to the fact that each platform generates and displays
different information in different formats of ifconfig results.
The linux version is used over the other platforms because of the 
amount of data the default command outputs.

SEE ALSO

linux command /sbin/ifconfig

NOTES

ifconfig output contains more information than the values that are
extracted in this module. More values can be added if there are any 
requests to do so.
