Net-Int-Stats version 2.1
===========================

NAME
    Net::Int::Stats - Reports specific ifconfig values for a network interface

SYNOPSIS
    use Net::Int::Stats;

    my $get = Net::Int::Stats->new();

    # get a value for a specific interface
    my $int     = 'eth0';
    my $stat	= 'rx_packets';
    my $packets = $get->value($int, $stat);

    # get a list of all interfaces
    my @interface_list = $get->interfaces();

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a list of all interfaces and various statistics generated from the ifconfig command 
    for specific interfaces. RX values consist of packets, errors, dropped, overruns, frame, and bytes. TX 
    values consist of packets, errors, dropped, overruns, carrier, and bytes. In addition IPv4 address, collisions, 
    and txqueuelen are reported. Values are in the format of type:n - ex 'packets:123456'. The interfaces() method 
    returns a space delimited list of all interfaces. Ex: lo eth0 eth1.
    

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module is platform dependent. It uses the linux version
of /sbin/ifconfig. Other platforms such as the windows equivalent
of ipconfig, mac osx, and other versions of unix are not supported. 
This is due to the fact that each platform generates and displays
different information in different formats of ifconfig results.
The linux version is used over the other platforms because of the 
amount of data the default command outputs.

SEE ALSO

linux command /sbin/ifconfig

NOTES

ifconfig output contains more information than the values that are
extracted in this module. More values and/or support for other
operating systems can be added if there are any requests to do so.
